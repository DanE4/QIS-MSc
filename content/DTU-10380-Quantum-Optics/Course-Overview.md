## Learning objectives

- Understand quantization of the electromagnetic field and coherence properties of optical quantum states.
- Explain mixed and pure optical quantum states and calculate measurable quantities.
- Use mathematical representations of states of light (Fock, position, Wigner).
- Describe measurement techniques such as homodyne detection and photon counting.
- Explain atom-light interaction in semi-classical and fully quantum models (including Jaynes-Cummings).
- Understand open dissipative quantum systems and cavity QED.
- Discuss protection against decoherence and disentanglement.
- Analyze quantum-state transformations using optical elements (beam splitters, parametric amplifiers, phase plates).
- Apply quantum optics to metrology, information processing, and opto-mechanics.
- Understand advanced experiments in quantum optics.
